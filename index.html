        "I was politically sentient in Russia around 2000, same vibes when Putin was taking over. Same playbook, and same discussions—‘let’s just wait and see.’ This is scary as shit already. I moved to the US in 2011, and now feel like I’m losing the second country in a row."

    <p>America got way more than we bargained for, and much faster and sooner than anybody thought - we are experiencing a <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2025/02/aba-supports-the-rule-of-law/">constitutional crisis</a> and a <a href="https://isthisacoup.com/">coup in progress.</a></p>
    <p class="emphasis">It's not too late to stop this — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/stand-up-and-be-counted-six-ways-to-protest-that-will-make-your-voice-heard">peaceful protest</a> <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64920">works</a></p>
    <p>I'm standing up to protect our democracy through the only historically proven means I know — <a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/peace-protests-dallas-response/">peaceful protest</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-x-doge-government-efficiency-e78ac431e7bbf2ae8513594078f1408b">disruptive boycotts.</a> Stand with me to restore the rule of law, support our courts and re-balance the separation of powers between our three co-equal branches of government.</p>
    <p>Every Friday starting February 21st, I’ll be at my county courthouse, protesting peacefully for change. My signs will say: <strong>“RESTORE RULE OF LAW”</strong> and <strong>“IMPEACH + REMOVE”</strong>. It's time for the lawlessness of the Trump regime to end.</p>
    <p>I'll also mark every Friday by voting with my wallet — no online shopping, no national chains. Instead, I’ll support local small businesses, especially those run by immigrants or committed to DEI.</p>
    <p>Every day I will wear my chosen symbol of protest, adorning my dark grey and black — I ask that you choose your own symbol of protest to show you're standing up for freedom and democracy.</p>
    <p>I will change my spending habits — I'll choose retailers that I will outright boycott due to their anti-DEI measures, and spend my money on companies that have stood up for the best American values.</p>
    <p class="emphasis">Don't let yourself be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/trump-executive-actions-democracy">overwhelmed into inaction</a></p>
    <p>We can fix our country if millions of us stand up for democracy and the rule of law — just 20% of Biden/Harris voters protesting would virtually ensure the end of the Trump regime. We need to be visible, we need to be wide-spread — every county courthouse in the country. I’d rather try and fail at something ambitious and bold than sit back, wait, and do nothing while our democracy fails.</p>
    <p>Want to help? You can organize Friday protests at your own county courthouse. I’d also love support with website design, content creation (non-violent + positive messaging), and spreading the word on social media. Email <a href="mailto:every.friday.resist@gmail.com">every.friday.resist@gmail.com</a> — especially if you organize your own local protests, I'd like to know so I can track and update as our numbers grow.</p>
    <p>I’ll be out there Friday the 21st, and every Friday after that. Stand up with me?</p>
