        "I was politically sentient in Russia around 2000, same vibes when Putin was taking over. Same playbook, and same discussions—‘let’s just wait and see.’ This is scary as shit already. I moved to the US in 2011, and now feel like I’m losing the second country in a row."

    <p>America got way more than we bargained for, and much faster than anybody thought possible — we are experiencing a <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2025/02/aba-supports-the-rule-of-law/">constitutional crisis</a> and a <a href="https://isthisacoup.com/">coup in progress.</a></p>
    <p class="emphasis">It's not too late to stop this — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/stand-up-and-be-counted-six-ways-to-protest-that-will-make-your-voice-heard">peaceful protest</a> <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=64920">works</a></p>
    <p>We're standing up to protect our democracy through the only historically proven means we know — <a href="https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/peace-protests-dallas-response/">peaceful protest</a> and <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/social-pressures-affect-corporate-strategy-performance">strategic</a> <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/technology/boycott-twitter-campaigning">boycotts.</a> Stand with us to restore the rule of law, support our courts, uphold the Constitution, and renew the balance of power between our three co-equal branches of government.</p>
    <p>Every Friday starting February 21, we'll be at county courthouses, protesting peacefully for change. It's time for the lawlessness of the Trump regime to end.</p>
    <p>We will also mark every Friday by voting with our wallets to reflect our values — no online shopping, no national chains. Instead, we’ll support local small businesses, especially those run by immigrants or committed to DEI.</p>
    <p>Every day we will wear our chosen symbol of protest to show that we oppose our one-sided government and support bipartisan efforts to create a just and fair country with laws that serve us all equally. We ask that you choose your own symbol of protest to show you're standing up for freedom and democracy.</p>
    <p>We are changing our spending habits — choosing retailers to boycott due to their anti-DEI measures, and spending our money on companies that have stood up for the best and most inclusive of American values.</p>
    <p class="emphasis">Don't let yourself be paralyzed by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/trump-executive-actions-democracy">flood of bad news</a></p>
    <p>We can fix our country if millions of us stand up for democracy and the rule of law — just 20% of Biden/Harris voters protesting <b>Every Friday</b> would virtually ensure the end of the Trump regime. We need to be visible, we need to be wide-spread — every county courthouse across the country. We’d rather try and fail at something ambitious and bold than sit back, wait, and do nothing while our democracy fails.</p>
    <p>Want to help? You can organize Friday protests at your own county courthouse. We would appreciate help with spreading the word on social media. Email <a href="mailto:every.friday.resist@gmail.com">every.friday.resist@gmail.com</a> — especially if you organize your own local protests. We'd love to know so we can track and update as our numbers grow.</p>
    <p>Join us this Friday, and Every Friday, as we gather at county courthouses to demand change and defend democracy.</p>
    <p class="tagline">#EveryFriday — until he's gone.</p>
